Ring-out Rumble is a local multiplayer VS arena game where you give your oppenents the little push they need... right out of the ring!  
Collect stat changes to get faster, shoot more often, or be more resistant to your opponent's charms! *  
*_Not all of these stat effects may exist._  

With pick-up-and-play controller... controls, anyone can play!  
Note, while a keyboard CAN be used, it really shouldn't be...
